# Digit_recognition
My solution to the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview

# What I learned 
In this competition I learned how to create a Neural Network with Keras, how to train a model 
and what do I need to train it. What is overfitting and underfitting. Such algorithms as Adam 
and metrics uploading a model. 

# Managed score 
I managed to get a score of 0.99271 which is a 218/1729 which is to 12 %.
